# YouTube-Clip-Finder
Simple site that can search the spoken text within a video to find specifc clips using a Flask backend and vanilla HTML, CSS, JS in the front-end. Written in a day for fun and practice with more web stuff.

Example of using the site:

### TODO
- allow for fuzzy search
- search entire text block instead of smaller chunks (text being searched could span across multiple transcript chunks)
- find a better way of fetching video metadata (videos with embedding disabled wont be loaded)
